# Humanoid Stair Climbing based on dedicated Plane Segment Estimation and Multi-contact Motion Generation

Source code for the motion-planning part of the paper.

## Abstract

Stair climbing is still a challenging task for humanoid robots, especially in
unknown environments. In this paper, we address this problem from perception to
execution. Our first contribution is a real-time plane segment estimation
method using unorganized lidar data *without* prior models of the staircase. We
then integrate this solution with humanoid motion planning. Our second
contribution is a stair-climbing motion generator where estimated plane
segments are used to compute footholds and stability polygons. We evaluate our
method on various staircases. We also demonstrate the feasibility of the
generated trajectories in a real-life experiment with the humanoid robot HRP-4.
